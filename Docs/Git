How I use git most of the time.

1. Make changes in DeadEndsXcode. Test them.

2. Run difftree program that shows diffs between DeadEndsVScode and DeadEndsXcode.

3. Edit output of difftree to creates a shell program that runs pullfile and the changed files
   (pull moves them from Xcode to VScode; pushfile the other way [for makefiles, scripts, ...]

4. Use VScode Git to make a commit.

5. Use VSCode Git to push to repository.
