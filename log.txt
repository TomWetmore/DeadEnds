Error in "st_db.li" at line 196: error calling built-in function: extractplaces.
  a. Find source of first message.
    Gets past. Seems to work. Want to prove it, but pvalueToString not implemented for PVList objects.
  b. Implement pvalueToString for PVLists.
    Implemented and the list seems empty. Look into valueToList.
  c. valueToList.
    Got it working.
  d. extractplaces
    Had misconception on its function. Made changes. ChatGPT helped. Seems to be working.
  e. the List created by extractplaces modified to hold strings, not PValues.
     working.
